    Identification of external CSS stylesheet reference as an absolute URI.

    Use the absolute URI of the CSS stylesheet when there is no knowledge of
    where the CSS stylesheet is located relative to the XSLT stylesheet that
    is using this XSLStyle stylesheet for rendering.

    Change the test to <literal>false()</literal> and the otherwise to
    the desired relative URI in order to embed the URI into the generated

    stylesheet that overrides thid definition of the global parameter, or
    (b) invoke this parameter with a particular URI.
