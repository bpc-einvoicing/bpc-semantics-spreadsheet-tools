  <xs:title>Using this shell</xs:title>
  <para>
    This shell only defines default values for the invocation parameters of the
    XSLStyle environment.  It imports the core stylesheets for this XSLStyle
    environment, providing values used by the core.
  </para>
  <para>
    There are two ways to take advantage of this shell:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      you can make a copy of this shell, set your own values for all defaults,
      and import the core stylesheets for the environment as this does, or
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      you can create your own shell to import this shell and set your own
      values for only those defaults you want to change, leaving the other
      defaults as they are.
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
    The latter approach is more resilient to future changes to the core
    stylesheets that may require new default parameters that must be found
    in the shell.  If they are not found in your copy of the shell, there
    may be errors preventing the core from being used.
  </para>

      Each of these parameters is ignored if a like-named attribute
      (without the "<literal>xslstyle-</literal>" prefix) is specified on
      the top-level <literal>&lt;xs:doc></literal> element of the
      stylesheet being styled.
